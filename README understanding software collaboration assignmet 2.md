# Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration  ASSIGNMENT 2 

This repository contains written explanations and reflections on key concepts in **software construction**, **team collaboration**, and the **responsible use of AI in software development**.

## 1. Difference Between Programming and Software Construction

**Programming** is the act of writing code to solve a specific problem. It focuses mainly on making the code work.

**Software construction** is broader and includes planning, writing clean code, testing, documenting, and organizing the code so that it can be maintained and improved over time.

### Real-World Example

Programming is like cooking a single meal for yourself by following a recipe.  
Software construction is like running a restaurant: you still cook food, but you also think about cleanliness, teamwork, consistent quality, and how the kitchen will operate every day.

A program may work today, but well-constructed software continues to work and improve over many years.

## 2. Problems Caused by Poor Maintainability

Poor maintainability occurs when software is difficult to understand, modify, or fix. This can lead to serious problems, especially as the system grows or changes hands.

### Example Situation

Imagine a hospital management system written without clear structure or documentation. If the original developer leaves and a bug appears in the patient records module, new developers may struggle to understand the code.

This could delay fixing the issue, cause incorrect patient data, and even affect medical decisions. Poor maintainability increases costs, risks, and system downtime.

## 3. Importance of Version Control in Team-Based Development

Version control is a system used by developer teams to track and manage changes to code over time.
- It enables collaboration without conflicts allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's work
- It keeps a complete history tracking every change with who, what and why the change was made simplifying troubleshooting and fixing bugs.
- it allows safe experimentation as developers can create branches for new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
- It enables rollback and disaster recovery allowing developers to revert to the previous stable version instantly.

## 4. How Code Reviews Improve Software Quality and Developer Skills

Code reviews involve developers checking each other’s code before it becomes part of the main project.

This process improves software quality by:
- Catching bugs early
- Improving code readability
- Ensuring coding standards are followed

Code reviews also help developers learn from one another. Junior developers gain feedback and guidance, while experienced developers reinforce best practices. Over time, this shared learning improves both individual skills and the overall quality of the software.

## 5. How AI Can Help Without Replacing Learning

Artificial Intelligence can help developers understand code by:
- Explaining what a piece of code does
- Suggesting improvements
- Pointing out possible errors

This makes learning faster and reduces frustration.

However, AI should not replace learning. Developers still need to think critically, practice writing code, and understand concepts themselves. AI works best as a support tool—similar to a tutor—helping learners understand ideas while they continue to develop their own problem-solving skills. Unfortunately to date, AI misuse is resulting in false developers who lack capacity for critical thinking and problem solving which AI is not capable of.
